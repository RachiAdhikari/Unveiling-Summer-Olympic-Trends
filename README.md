The Olympics dataset, spanning 1896 to 2024, contains over 250,000 records and provides a comprehensive view of performance trends, medal distributions, and participation patterns in the Summer Olympics. This project explores several key aspects, including identifying the top 10 medal-winning countries, analyzing the most popular events, evaluating country specialization in specific sports, and predicting the future performance of the U.S. Women’s Gymnastics team. It also examines gender disparities in participation and medal distribution, as well as the impact of hosting on a country’s performance.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, features 11 attributes such as athlete names, genders, countries, events, and medals, with no missing values. Through methods like grouping, regression, clustering, and time series analysis, the project derives actionable insights. The United States emerged as the most dominant nation in total medals, particularly in athletics, while countries like Kenya and Jamaica excel in long-distance running and sprinting, respectively. Gender analysis revealed an encouraging trend toward greater participation and success for female athletes over time.

Key findings include the most popular Olympic events, such as athletics and swimming, the significant advantage for host countries in medal counts, and the sustained excellence of the U.S. Women’s Gymnastics team based on historical trends. This project highlights the potential of sports analytics in uncovering historical dominance, understanding gender equity, and predicting future performance trends, offering valuable insights into the evolution of the Olympic Games.
